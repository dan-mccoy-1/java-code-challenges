Notes:
    - Edabit.com code challenges:
        - Difficulty Levels:
            - The difficulty levels assigned to these code challenges come from the website from which I got the challenges (edabit.com).
                - The website users vote on these difficulty levels, so they're based on a consensus from Java users.
        - Code Structure:
            - The website features a built-in compiler and each challenge has a test suite it must pass
            - The challenge interface provides an empty static function that already has a name
                - I've decided to keep this structure (including function name) so I can directly copy/paste my challenge code between this project and the website
            - The user is asked to complete the function, returning the requested value (other functions can be added)
